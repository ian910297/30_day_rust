# GTK-SNAKE

## Requirements
* [Gtk-rs: Requirements](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/requirements.html)  
If you are under windows operate system, you would have to execute complex commands to build GTK environment.  
I cannot build successfully under windows environment, so I recommend execute under linux environment.  
Alaways occur the error `error: linking with link.exe failed: exit code: 1181`
