# GTK-SNAKE

## Requirements
* [Gtk-rs: Requirements](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/requirements.html)
If you are under windows operate system, you would have to execute complex commands to build GTK environment. 

I cannot build successfully under windows environment, so I recommend execute under linux environment.
Alaways occur the error `error: linking with `link.exe` failed: exit code: 1181`
